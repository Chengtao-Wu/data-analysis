# data-analysis
1.Introduction
This repository showcases and practices data analysis and visualization projects.It includes case studies from retail, finance, and other domains, aiming to build hands-on experience in data preprocessing, modeling, visualization, and deriving business insights.

2.Repository Structure
retail_project/: Retail data analysis (e.g., customer behavior, sales forecasting)
finance_project/: Financial data analysis (e.g., credit risk modeling, fraud detection)
others/: Miscellaneous exercises and exploratory analyses
requirements.txt: Python dependencies required for running the projects

3.Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
pandas / numpy: data preprocessing and feature engineering
matplotlib / seaborn: basic visualization
scikit-learn: modeling and evaluation
Visualization Tool: Tableau for interactive dashboards and business insights

4.Project List
Retail Project
Data Source: Kaggle retail transaction datasets
Focus: customer segmentation, product recommendation, sales trend analysis
Tools & Methods: Python preprocessing, clustering algorithms, time-series forecasting, Tableau dashboards

Finance Project
Data Source: open credit risk or fraud detection datasets
Focus: building risk-scoring models and detecting fraudulent transactions
Tools & Methods: logistic regression, random forest, feature selection, model evaluation

Other Practice Projects
Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), small Kaggle challenges, and visualization practices

5.Future Work
Add more domain-specific projects (e.g., healthcare, energy)
Enhance interactivity in visualizations and expand Tableau dashboards
Include automated data preprocessing scripts and reporting pipelines
